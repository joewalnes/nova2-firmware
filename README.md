Nova iOS SDK
============

![](http://cdn.photojojo.net/store/awesomeness/productImages/nova-wireless-phone-flash-e5fb.0000001402246485.gif)

Official iOS SDK for [Nova Bluetooth iPhone flash](https://www.novaphotos.com).

*This is version 2 of the SDK which has undergone [significant changes](CHANGES.md) from version 1.
If you are migrating, see [V2 migration guide](MIGRATING-V2.md).*

What does this do?
------------------

* Uses BluetoothLE to discover nearby Nova flashes and communicate with them
* Supports both Nova and Nova Pro devices
* Allows control of multiple flashes (each can be uniquely identified)
* Callback to notify app when user presses trigger button on the device [Nova Pro only]
* Monitor signal strength of each flash (e.g. which is closest to the phone)
* Monitor battery charge capacity of each flash [Nova Pro only]
* Supports both automatic and manual connect modes
* Manual connect: clients can explore Nova flashes in range, signal strength and explicitly connect and disconnect as needed
* Automatic connect: SDK will automatically connect to closest flash (single or multiple flashes) or a previously remembered flash
* Provides seamless connection user experience from app - the user does *not* need to explictly pair a flash in Bluetooth settings
* Allow connected flashes to be lit and unlit with user defined brightness and color temperature
* Allow setting/retrieving on device flash defaults when triggered by device [Nova Pro only]

What could be done with it?
---------------------------

Just some ideas...

* Integrate with a custom camera app
* Create a flashlight app
* Morse code beacon
* Use Nova devices as beacons in a location aware app
* Some sweet art

Examples
--------

A hello world app is provided that simply connects to the closest flash and toggles the light on and off every second.

* [Swift example](https://github.com/novaphotos/nova-ios-sdk/blob/master/NovaHelloWorldSwift/NovaHelloWorldSwift/AppDelegate.swift)
* [Objective-C example](https://github.com/novaphotos/nova-ios-sdk/blob/master/NovaHelloWorldObjC/NovaHelloWorldObjC/AppDelegate.m)

Installation
------------

Use [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) and add to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'NovaSDK', '~> 2.0.0'
```

The library is small and its only dependency is the system CoreBluetooth framework.

Core types
----------

* `NVFlashService`: The core service used to discover nearby flashes. Clients can iterate through available nearby flashes, set rules for auto-connection and pause/resume scanning when the app moves to the background.

* `NVFlashServiceDelegate`: Optional delegate protocol that can be implemented by client to receive callbacks when new flashes are discovered, connected or disconnected.

* `NVFlash`: Each discovered flash. Clients can explicitly connect/disconnect, monitor signal strength and connectivity status, and control the light emitted from each flash.

* `NVFlashSettings`: A configuration used when telling the flash to light up. Includes warm LED brightness, cool LED brightness and a timeout to automatically shutdown the flash.

* `NVFlashStatus`: Enum type describing status of a flash.
   * `Available`: in range and available to be connected to
   * `Unavailable`: no longer in range
   * `Connecting`: connection in progress
   * `Ready`: connected and ready for use
   * `Busy`: connected but currently processing an existing command

Usage
-----

### Initialization

Initialize the Nova flash service. A good time to do this is in `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

// Setup. Do this when app starts.
// A good time is applicationDidFinishLaunching:
NVFlashService *flashService = [NVFlashService new];

// Optionally, set a delegate implementing NVFlashServiceDelegate to be
// notified of flash discovery/connection events.
flashService.delegate = self;
```

```swift
// Swift

// Setup. Do this when app starts.
// A good time is applicationDidFinishLaunching:
let flashService = NVFlashService()

// Optionally, set a delegate implementing NVFlashServiceDelegate to be
// notified of flash discovery/connection events.
flashService.delegate = self
```

In `applicationDidBecomeActive:` you should enable the service, which
activates the Bluetooth radio and begins scanning:

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[flashService enable];
```

```swift
// Swift
flashService.enable()
```

In `applicationWillResignActive:` you should disable the service, which
shuts down the BluetoothLE scanning, conserving the battery life of
both the iPhone and Nova:

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[flashService disable];
```

```swift
// Swift
flashService.disable()
```

### Discovering nearby flashes

While the flash service is enabled it will automatically perform Bluetooth scans to discover
nearby flashes.

There are two options for knowing which flashes are in range:
1. Periodically look at the contents of `flashService.flashes` or `flashService.connectedFlashes` array
2. Receive a callback by implementing the `NVFlashServiceDelegate` protocol

#### Iterating over flashes array

The `NVFlashService.flashes` array contains `NVFlash` objects and can be queried at any time and returns all flashes that have been discovered.

The `NVFlashService.connectedFlashes` is similar except it contains the subset of flashes that are currently connected.

```objective-c
// Objective-C
for (id<NVFlash> flash in flashService.flashes) { // alternatively flashService.connectedFlashes
  NSLog(@"flash: identifier=%@, status=%@, signalStrength=%f",
        flash.identifier,                  // unique ID assigned to each flash
        NVFlashStatusString(flash.status), // connectivity status
        flash.signalStrength);             // value from 0.0 (weakest) to 1.0 (strongest)
}
```

```swift
// Swift
for flash in flashService.flashes as [NVFlash] { // alternatively flashService.connectedFlashes
  NSLog("flash: identifier=%@, status=%@, signalStrength=%f",
        flash.identifier,                  // unique ID assigned to each flash
        NVFlashStatusString(flash.status), // connectivity status
        flash.signalStrength)              // value from 0.0 (weakest) to 1.0 (strongest)
}
```

#### Receiving delegate callbacks

Optionally, a client may implement the `NVFlashServiceDelegate` protocol and set it as the `flashService.delegate` to receive callbacks as discovery and connection events occur.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

// Implement NVFlashServiceDelegate protocol. All methods are optional.

- (void) flashServiceAddedFlash:(id<NVFlash>)flash {
  NSLog(@"added flash %@", flash.identifier);
}

- (void) flashServiceRemovedFlash:(id<NVFlash>)flash {
  NSLog(@"removed flash %@", flash.identifier);
}

- (void) flashServiceConnectedFlash:(id<NVFlash>)flash {
  NSLog(@"connected flash %@", flash.identifier);
}

- (void) flashServiceDisconnectedFlash:(id<NVFlash>)flash {
  NSLog(@"disconnected flash %@", flash.identifier);
}

```

```swift
// Swift

// Implement NVFlashServiceDelegate protocol. All methods are optional.

func flashServiceAddedFlash(flash: NVFlash) {
  NSLog("added flash %@", flash.identifier)
}

func flashServiceRemovedFlash(flash: NVFlash) {
  NSLog("removed flash %@", flash.identifier)
}

func flashServiceConnectedFlash(flash: NVFlash) {
  NSLog("connected flash %@", flash.identifier)
}

func flashServiceDisconnectedFlash(flash: NVFlash) {
  NSLog("disconnected flash %@", flash.identifier)
}
```

### Connecting to flashes

There are two ways to connect to flashes:
1. Manually call `connect`/`disconnect` on `NVFlash` instances of interest. This gives the most control.
2. Enable `autoConnect` and allow the flash service to automatically connect to the closest Nova for you. This is the simplest.

#### Auto connect

This is the recommend approach as it lets the flash service do the hard work for you.

When `autoConnect` is enabled,the flash service will periodically attempt to connect to a suitable Nova (or multiple Novas). Clients will know when a Nova is connected by looking at the `flashService.connectedFlashes` array or handling `flashServiceConnectedFlash:`/`flashServiceDisconnectedFlash:` callbacks.

##### Auto connect to the closest Nova

```objective-c
// Objective-C

// call this after initializing NVFlashService
flashService.autoConnect = YES;
```

```swift
// Swift

// call this after initializing NVFlashService
flashService.autoConnect = true
```

The default auto connect rules will attempt to connect to:
* just **1** Nova at a time
* the Nova with the strongest signal strength
* from the set **all** discovered Novas with signal strength >0.1 (10%)

##### Auto connect to multiple Novas

The above rules can be changed. For example:

```objective-c
// Objective-C

flashService.autoConnectMaxFlashes = 4;          // connect to the 4 closest Novas
flashService.autoConnectMinSignalStrength = 0.5; // require signal strength >=50%
```

```swift
// Swift

flashService.autoConnectMaxFlashes = 4           // connect to the 4 closest Novas
flashService.autoConnectMinSignalStrength = 0.5  // require signal strength >=50%
```

##### Remember a Nova and only auto connect to that

In some cases clients may wish to remember a flash and only reconnect to that same flash (or flashes) in the future.

To do this, clients should store a list of `NVFlash.identifier` values. These are strings that could be persisted locally. Each string is unique for a given flash.

Upon reconnecting:

```objective-c
// Objective-C

// Only auto connect to specific flashes.
// Identifiers are strings previously obtained from NVFlash.identifier
flashService.autoConnectWhiteList = @[identifier1, identifier2];
```
```swift
// Swift

// Only auto connect to specific flashes.
// Identifiers are strings previously obtained from NVFlash.identifier
flashService.autoConnectWhiteList = [identifier1, identifier2]
```

#### Manual connection

For clients that want more control over which Novas to connect to, the individual `NVFlash` instances can be iterated over (see above) and explicitly connected/disconnected at appropriate times.

**Important**: Do not attempt to manually connect to flashes if `autoConnect` is enabled. If in doubt use `autoConnect` instead (see above) - it's much simpler.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

id<NVFlash> flash = /* whichever flash instance */;

// to connect
[flash connect];

// to disconnect
[flash disconnect];
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C

let flash: NVFlash = /* whichever flash instance */

// to connect
flash.connect()

// to disconnect
flash.disconnect()
```

#### Lighting up Nova

Nova contains banks of LEDs, half of which have a warm white tint and the other half have a cool white tint. The brightness of both banks can be controlled individually for different variations of brightness and color temperature.

##### Choosing brightness and color temperature

The `NVFlashSettings` object holds the desired brightness/temperature settings. The fields are:
* `warm`: Brightness of warm LEDs from 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness)
* `cool`: Brightness of cool LEDs from 0 (off) to 255 (full brightness)

For convenience, there are presets used for commonly used settings:

```objective-c
// Objective-C

NSFlashSettings *settings = [NFFlashSettings bright];

// or...
NSFlashSettings *settings = [NFFlashSettings gentle];
NSFlashSettings *settings = [NFFlashSettings neutral];
NSFlashSettings *settings = [NFFlashSettings warm];
NSFlashSettings *settings = [NFFlashSettings customWarm:123, cool:201];
```

```swift
// Swift

let settings = NFFlashSettings.bright()

// or...
let settings = NFFlashSettings.gentle()
let settings = NFFlashSettings.neutral()
let settings = NFFlashSettings.warm()
let settings = NFFlashSettings.custom()
let settings = NFFlashSettings.customWarm(123, cool: 201)
```

##### Turning on the lights

Once the settings (see above) have been defined, use `beginFlash` to send a message to the flash to activate the LEDs.

*Important*: Due to the nature of BluetoothLE, there is a slight delay between making this call and the LEDs actually lighting up. If timing is important, you can pass a callback that will be called when the flash has acknowledged that the LEDs are on.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

id<NVFlash> flash = /* whichever flash you want to control */;

// Fire and forget. Flash typically lights up within 100-200 milliseconds.
[flash beginFlash:settings];

// Alternatively, fire and pass a callback to know when flash has responded
[flash beginFlash:settings withCallback:^(BOOL success) {
  if (success) {
    NSLog(@"Flash is now lit up");
  } else {
    NSLog(@"Flash failed to light. Try charging it.");
  }
}];
```

```swift
// Swift

let flash: NVFlash = // whichever flash you want to control

// Fire and forget. Flash typically lights up within 100-200 milliseconds.
flash.beginFlash(settings)

// Alternatively, fire and pass a callback to know when flash has responded
flash.beginFlash(settings) {success in
  if (success) {
    NSLog("Flash is now lit up")
  } else {
    NSLog("Flash failed to light. Try charging it.")
  }
}
```

##### Turning off the lights

To turn off the lights, call `endFlash`.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

[flash.endFlash];
```

```swift
// Swift

flash.endFlash()
```

Like `beginFlash`, you may also pass a callback to `endFlash` to get notified when the flash has acknowledged that it's now off.

##### Flash timeouts

The Nova hardware includes a timeout feature to automatically turn the flash off after a certain amount of time. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that if an app crashes or other unexpected events occur on the phone, the flash will not remain on and drain all the battery.

The **default timeout is 10 seconds**. This is approximate because Nova does not contain a high resolution timer. In reality it will be accurate with about 20% tolerance.

To change the timeout, you can modify the `NVFlashSettings`.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

NVFlashSettings *settings = [[NVFlashSettings warm] flashSettingsWithTimeout:20000)]; // in milliseconds
```

```swift
// Swift

let settings = NVFlashSettings.warm().flashSettingsWithTimeout(20000) // in milliseconds
```

### Putting it all together

Here's that hello world app again. It demonstrates initializing the service, auto connecting to the closest Nova, listening to connect/disconnect events and controlling the light.

* [Swift example](https://github.com/novaphotos/nova-ios-sdk/blob/master/NovaHelloWorldSwift/NovaHelloWorldSwift/AppDelegate.swift)
* [Objective-C example](https://github.com/novaphotos/nova-ios-sdk/blob/master/NovaHelloWorldObjC/NovaHelloWorldObjC/AppDelegate.m)

Coordinating a camera flash
---------------------------

If you are integrating Nova into a camera app, here is the basic flow of events for taking a photo.

Triggering a flash should only be attempted when `flashService.status == NVFlashServiceReady`.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

// Step 1: Tell flash to activate.
[flash beginFlash:settings withCallback:^ (BOOL success) {

  // Step 2: This callback is called when the flash has acknowledged that
  //         it is lit.

  // Check whether flash activated succesfully.
  if (success) {

    // Step 3: Tell camera to take photo.
    [myCameraAbstraction takePhotoWithCallback:(^ {

      // Step 4: When photo has been captured, turn the flash off.
      [flashService:endFlashWithCallback:(^ {
        // Step 5: Done. Ready to take another photo.
      })];

    })];

  } else {
    // Error: flash could not be triggered.
  }
}];
```

```swift
// Swift

// Step 1: Tell flash to activate.
flash.beginFlash(settings) { success in

  // Step 2: This callback is called when the flash has acknowledged that
  //         it is lit.

  // Check whether flash activated succesfully.
  if (success) {

    // Step 3: Tell camera to take photo.
    myCameraAbstraction.takePhotoWithCallback() {

      // Step 4: When photo has been captured, turn the flash off.
      flashService.endFlash() { success in
        // Step 5: Done. Ready to take another photo.
      }

    }

  } else {
    // Error: flash could not be triggered.
  }
}
```

Trigger button
--------------

**Nova Pro only**

Nova Pro devices have a physical trigger button. This SDK can provide notifications
when the button is pressed down and released.

To check if this functionality is available on the connected flash, read the boolean
`NVFlash.remoteTriggerSupported`.

Workflow:

* Upon being **pressed down**, the device shall create a **prelight flash** used to
  slightly illuminate the scene. This aids the camera in acquiring focus and gives
  the user an indication of what the final composition will look like.

* Upon being **released**, the device shall increase brightness to a **regular flash**,
  and the camera should take the final photo. When the app has completed the photo,
  it may call a `completed()` callback signaling that the flash to deactivate
  sooner and conserve energy. If it doesn't call this in a timely manner the flash
  will deactivate automatically anyway based on a default timeout (see next section).

To receive notifications of the button being pressed, clients should implement
the `NVFlashDelegate` protocol and register itself at `NVFlash.delegate`.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

- (void) flashTriggerButtonPressed:(id<NVFlash>) flash
{
  NSLog(@"Flash button pressed down. Now would be a good time to focus");
}

- (void) flashTriggerButtonReleased:(id<NVFlash>) flash withCompletion:(NVTriggerCompletion) completed
{
  NSLog(@"Flash button released. Now would be a good time to take the photo");
  // Call completed() after photo is taken to deactivate flash. May be asyncronous.
  completed();
}
```

```swift
// Swift

func flashTriggerButtonPressed(flash: NVFlash) {
  NSLog("Flash button pressed down. Now would be a good time to focus")
}

func flashTriggerButtonPressed(flash: NVFlash, withCompletion completed:NVTriggerCompletion) {
  NSLog("Flash button released. Now would be a good time to take the photo")
  // Call completed() after photo is taken to deactivate flash. May be asyncronous.
  completed()
}
```

Flash default settings
----------------------

**Nova Pro only**

When users press the button down on the Nova Pro device, the light will start in **preflash**
mode to partially illuminate the scene (aid user and camera in the dark). When they release
the button the light will create a **regular** flash.

The exact light levels of these two types of light can be set by the app in advance through
the flash defaults. The flash defaults are stored on the Nova device and are saved even
when powered off.

To check if this functionality is supportred by the flash device, read the boolean
`NVFlash.flashDefaultsSupported`.

```objective-c
// Objective-C

// Load defaults stored on device
[flash loadFlashDefaults: ^(BOOL success, NVFlashDefaults* flashDefaults) {

  if (!success) {
    NSLog(@"Failed to load flash defaults");
    return;
  }

  NSLog(@"Regular flash settings: %@", flashDefaults.regular);
  NSLog(@"Preflash flash settings: %@", flashDefaults.preflash);

  // Update regular flash defaults to use warm light
  NVFlashDefaults * newFlashDefaults = [flashDefaults withRegular: [NVFlashSettings warm]];

  // Save defaults back to device
  [flash saveFlashDefaults: newFlashDefaults withCallback: ^(BOOL saveSuccess) {
    if (!saveSuccess) {
      NSLog(@"Failed to save defaults to device");
    } else {
      NSLog(@"Saved defaults to device. Yay");
    }
  }];
}];
```

```swift
// Swift

// Load defaults stored on device
flash.loadFlashDefaults() {success, flashDefaults in

  if (!success) {
    NSLog("Failed to load flash defaults")
    return
  }

  NSLog("Regular flash settings: %@", flashDefaults.regular)
  NSLog("Preflash flash settings: %@", flashDefaults.preflash)

  // Update regular flash defaults to use warm light
  let newFlashDefaults = flashDefaults.withRegular(NVFlashSettings.warm())

  // Save defaults back to device
  flash.saveFlashDefaults(newFlashDefaults) { saveSucces in
    if (!saveSuccess) {
      NSLog("Failed to save defaults to device")
    } else {
      NSLog("Saved defaults to device. Yay")
    }
  }];
}];
```


Battery levels
--------------

**Nova Pro only**

To read the battery charge level, read `NVFlash.batteryStrength`. It returns
a float from 0.0 (totally empty) to 1.0 (totally full). The battery level is
not exact - just an approximation.

This value is key-value-observable.

The value may be `NAN` if the value is not known, or the device does not support
remote battery monitoring.



Hints and tips. Tints and hips.
-------------------------------

### Observing flash property changes

Standard [key-value observing](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html) can be used on the `NVFlash` instance fields (e.g. `status`, `signalStrength`,  `lit`) to monitor when something about the flash changes. It is recommend to add/remove observers in either `flashServiceFlashAdded:`/`flashServiceFlashRemoved:` or `flashServiceConnectedFlash:`/`flashServiceDisconnectedFlash:` delegate callbacks.

### Threading

This library should only ever be called from the main thread. All calls are fast and non-blocking.

### Short light burts

For short bursts of light, it's often simpler to use a timeout on `NVFlashSettings` instead of explicitly calling `endFlash`.
