// This serves two purposes:
//
// 1. To act as a fallback mechanism in case the application crashes between beginning
//    the flash and ending it. This will ensure the flash eventually turns off and doesn't
//    waste too much battery power.
//
// 2. For very short flashes (say < 10ms), it is more effictive to begin a flash with a
//    timeout, than to explicitly end the flash. This should only be used for short flashes
//    as the timer on the hardware is not very accurate (it can drift +/- 20%).
